# Week 6: Final challenge

* In this folder, the student will find the neccessary files for the Final Challenge.
* The instruction for this challenge can be found inside the presentation *MCR2_Final_Challenge*.
* The instruction on how to install the Aruco Libraries for the Jetson can be found in *MCR2_ArucoMarkers*.
* The scripts for installing OpenCV in the Jetson (provided you read the instructions int he presentation).


## Description
* This challenge is intended for the student to review the concepts introduced in this course.
* This challenge consists in autonomously exploring an unknown environment using the Puzzlebot.
* The challenge must be implemented in Gazebo, and it is encouraged but not required to be implemented with the real robot.


## Notes
  - The gazebo world can be found in the folder "Gazebo Worlds"

  - Remember to make the nodes executable using the the following command inside the catkin_ws/src/basic_comms/src and catkin_ws/src/basic_comms/src
 folders 
```
 chmod +x signal_generator.py
 chmod +x process.py
```

## Rules
  * This is challenge not a class. The students are encouraged to research, improve tune explain their algorithms by themselves.
  * MCR2(Manchester Robotics) Reserves the right to answer a question if it is determined that the questions contains partially or totally an answer.
  * The students are welcomed to ask only about the theoretical aspect of the classed.
  * No remote control or any other form of human interaction with the simulator or ROS is allowed (except at the start when launching the files).
  * It is forbidden to use any other internet libraires with the exception of standard libraires or NumPy.
  * If in doubt about libraires please ask any teaching assistant.
  * Improvements to the algorithms are encouraged and may be used as long as the students provide the reasons and a detailed explanation on the improvements.
  * All the students must be respectful towards each other and abide by the previously defined rules.
  * Manchester robotics reserves the right to provide any form of grading. Grading and grading methodology are done by the professor in charge of the unit.
